# Exercise 14-3: OOP There it is pt. 3
In this exercise we are going to modify our shapes module and add a circle class.  The constructor for the circle class should require a raidus argument, and use that value to compute diameter, circumference, and surface area.
Your code is complete when you print the radius, diameter, circumference, and area of your circle object which should be constructed in main.
